Operator	        Use	Description

                                  concatenate strings
-	op1 - op2	Subtracts op2 from op1
*	op1 * op2	Multiplies op1 by op2
/	op1 / op2	Divides op1 by op2
%	op1 % op2	Computes the remainder of 
                                 dividing op1 by op2

Bitwise  operator

^	Bitwise XOR
~	Bitwise complement
<<	Shift left
>>	Shift right


Identity operator
is – returns True if the type of the value in the right operand points to the same type in the left operand. For example, type(3) is int evaluates to True because 3 is indeed an integer number.
is not – returns True if the type of the value in the right operand points to a different type than the value in the left operand. For example, type(3) is not float evaluates to True because 3 is not a floating-point value.
